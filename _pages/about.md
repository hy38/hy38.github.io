### Projects

- LLM1dFuzz
  - Proposed a systematic 1-day bug reproduction tool using GPT-4 Turbo.
  - Improved directed fuzzing performance by 37.5% across 15 programs using LLM-generated seeds.

- Fuzzing Survey
  - Maintaining an up-to-date genealogy database of over 361+ fuzzers.

- ChatFive
  - Developed a system utilizing multiple LLM agents to enhance user experience in personality tests.
  - Achieved 77% accuracy in key traits, with 85% of users preferring the system over the Big Five test.

- Edge-Cloud Migration of Intruder Detection System
  - Designed a communication protocol for edge-cloud migration to accelerate response in critical situations.
  - Implemented custom APIs using FastAPI, enabling seamless updates and integration for developers.

- DasMin
  - Architected a high-performance distributed IoT data storage system utilizing MinIO.
  - Improved GET request performance by 347% and PUT request by 155% across 4 nodes.

- Shot Tracker
  - Designed a novel shot group measurement IoT system using LoRa and YOLO V5.
  - Achieved 91.8% mean accuracy in indoor shot group measurements.
